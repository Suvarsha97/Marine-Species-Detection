Marine Species Detection using Deep Learning
This project uses deep learning techniques to detect and classify marine species from underwater images. The primary goal is to aid in marine biodiversity conservation by automating species identification through image recognition.

Objectives:
Automate the identification of marine species using deep learning.
Assist researchers in monitoring and conserving marine life.
Provide an accurate and scalable model for underwater species classification.

Architecture:
Model Used: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
MobileNetV2

Frameworks: Python, TensorFlow/Keras

Key Features:
Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
Model training and evaluation with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
Dataset sourced from Kaggle with 50,000+ labeled marine images
Results:
Achieved up to 92% accuracy on the test dataset.
Model performs well across multiple species categories.
